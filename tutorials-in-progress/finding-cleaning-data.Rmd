## Finding data


## NA NA NA NA

Read in your data--anytime R finds a cell with an empty value, it will put an "NA".  But your dataset may have other ways of indicating missing values.  Examine it after it's read in to figure out if there seem to be other values that should be marked as missing values

When in doubt, add the following to cover most cases:
```{r}
read.csv( na.strings=c("NA", "N/A", "Not Available", "#REF!")
```
